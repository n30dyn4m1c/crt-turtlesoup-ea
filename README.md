## 📊 Turtle Soup Logic (H4 EA)

The H4 script follows strict 3-candle logic:
- **Candle2**: Range candle
- **Candle1**: False breakout candle with a long wick
- **Candle0**: Currently forming candle (entry reference)

### Trade Levels
- **Entry**: Open of Candle0 (Buy Below / Sell Above)
- **SL**: Wick extreme of Candle1
- **TP1**: Midpoint of Candle2 range
- **TP2**: Candle2 extreme (opposite direction of the setup)

### Detection Conditions
- **Bullish TS**:
  - Candle2 is bearish
  - Candle1 is bullish and breaks Candle2 low
  - Candle1 closes above Candle2 close
  - Candle1 has a long lower wick

- **Bearish TS**:
  - Candle2 is bullish
  - Candle1 is bearish and breaks Candle2 high
  - Candle1 closes below Candle2 close
  - Candle1 has a long upper wick

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

- 3-candle CRTs are easier to encode. Multiple candle CRT setups will need additional logic
- Size of the range candle needs to be big
- Backtest on demo first for at least a week
- Filter out only high quality CRT & TS setups, ignore low quality setups
- Consider removing instruments with large spread
- Consider first entry above/below range candle high/low, and second entry above/below current candle open
- Turtle soup candle should not reach more than 50% of range candle, then it is invalid
- Note instruments that do not trade 24 hours, EA will not trigger if market is closed.
- Also if loaded in a live isntrument, EA will continuously give alert for an instrument if market closed with a setup formation
- Only valid range is a thick down-closed or thick up-closed candle
- EA might need instrument to be opened in Market Watch, for it to scan, so open all

Relationship between Range Candle (RC) and Turtle Soup Candle (TSC)
- For RC body incl wick must be larger than TSC body incl wick, let's say 2x
- TSC must not reach 50% and 100% CR after TS
- Check IRL-ERL confluence when a TS is detected
- Valid TS sweeps a high or a low
- Entry models: LTF CISD

- Timeframe alignment for HTF Premium/Discount Array to LTF TS
- Monthly PD array - Daily TS
- Weekly PD array - 4H TS
- Daily PD array -  1H TS
- 4H PD array - 15M TS

## 🎯 Future Improvements

- Timed trigger: H4 scans only during first 30 min of each candle
- Filter: Require TS body < 50% of range body
- Expand logic to multi-candle range breaks (2–5 bars)
- Same-direction Turtle Soup (e.g. bullish candle + bullish wick)
- Prevent duplicate alerts using per-symbol memory
- Merge timeframes into one EA with toggle switches
- Add dashboard with HTMX-style signal display
- Push/email/mobile notifications
- Add trading logic with SL/TP and lot sizing
